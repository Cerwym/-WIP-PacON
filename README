Here's my little project.
And here's my little idea;

Make a small game that can be run without user-interaction;
The AI NPC can navigate a large overworld to find 'dungeons'
Once a dungeon is found, the player can take control and explore / fight in said dungeon.

Possible features
-> 3D combat scene akin to Dragon Quest
-> Social Networking
-> User options for name, time scale, world size

Stuff
OpenGL is being used to keep the project portable (IF it goes well)
